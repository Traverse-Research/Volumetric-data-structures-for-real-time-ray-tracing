%Volumetric effects such as clouds, explosions, smoke and fog are important scene elements for computer games. While these can be efficiently handled in a rasterizer, path tracers typically struggle to render them efficiently. In this project we aim to enhance an existing commercial rendering framework to support volumetric ray tracing. We decouple this goal into Light transport, which is tackled in a separate parallel project, and designing a data structure which will allow the mentioned framework to perform efficient large scale volume ray tracing queries. This project will thus involve the implementation and evaluation of such a data structure. Evaluation will be done in terms of ray traversal speed, memory footprint and update timings. These metrics will be compared against a naive solution and the current industry standard volumetric data structure on the GPU.
