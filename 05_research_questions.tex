\subsection{Performance bottlnecks}\label{research_questions:performance_bottlenecks}

These requirements lead into the following research questions:\\

\noindent\textbf{What data structures, or combination of structures, are optimal for ray tracing, memory and animation, and can these structures be converted into each other?} We have already seen that there are different techniques which are optimized for different metrics. So if we know the optimal method for each of our requirements, we can work towards combining their strengths without having to create one structure which can do it all (which evidently does not exist, yet).

\noindent\textbf{Is volume traversal memory or compute bound?} This question should provide insight into future optimization techniques. Insight into questions like "if L1 cache size is increased by X amount, will this improve volume traversal speed?" or "if the clock speed of a GPU is increased, what will the impact on our volume traversal be?" will be acquired.
