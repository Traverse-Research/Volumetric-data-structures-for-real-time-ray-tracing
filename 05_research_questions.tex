\section{Research questions}\label{research_questions}
As a result of our introduction and requirements, there are two main questions that we want answered which are written below.

\subsection{Optimal data structure}\label{research_questions:optimal_data_structure}

\noindent\textbf{What data structures, or combination of structures, are optimal for ray tracing, memory, simulation and animation, and can these structures be converted into each other?} We have already seen that different techniques are optimized for different metrics. So if we know the optimal method for each of our requirements, we can work towards combining their strengths without having to create one structure that can do it all (which evidently does not exist, yet).

\subsection{Performance bottlenecks}\label{research_questions:performance_bottlenecks}
\noindent\textbf{Is volume traversal memory or compute bound?} This question should provide insight into future optimization techniques. Insight into questions like "If L1 cache size is increased by X amount, will this improve volume traversal speed?" or "If the clock speed of a GPU is increased, what will the impact on our volume traversal be?" will be acquired.
